currently am generating the svg for use in the gui
not sure if its good but it seems to be generating ok
i have a feeling it needs fixing because some of the arrow
texts are duplicated and there is no way for the gui to reference them
problem is i don't have an easy way to test the svg is working.
maybe i should make it so i can click on the elements to test them.
it seems like i'm deviating from the goal, but i do need to test this.

ok then. new requirement: a querystring flag to put the svg in test mode:
?svg-test=1
